            <p>This easy pasta sauce will cook in about the 
                same time it takes to cook some dried pasta 
                in boiling salted water - we're talking about 
                quick and easy options here. These amounts serve 
                2 but are easy to scale up or down. Remember you 
                want about 75g of dried pasta per person - use 
                whatever shape you've got. Or, check out my 
                super-simple method for fresh pasta, using just 
                flour and water.

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>150 g dried spaghetti</li>
                <li class="meat">2 rashers of higher-welfare smoked streaky bacon</li>
                <li>1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>2 free-range eggs</li>
                <li>30 g Parmesan cheese, plus extra for grating</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    <div id="steps">
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions.</li>
                <li class="meat">Slice the bacon and place in a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with half a tablespoon of olive oil and a really good pinch of black pepper. Leave it to get super-golden and crispy, tossing occasionally, then turn off the heat.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl, then finely grate in the Parmesan and mix well.</li>
                <li>Use tongs to transfer your pasta straight into the pan and toss.</li>
                <li>Pour the Parmesan eggs into the pan, and keep everything moving, loosening with splashes of the pasta cooking water until you have a silky sauce. Make sure the pan is not too hot otherwise the eggs will scramble.</li>
                <li>Plate up the pasta, and finish with an extra grating of Parmesan.</li> 
            </ol>
